Artiom ArutiunovProfessor Stahl 1/10/16Programming Assignment 1Part 5The input I provided in step 5 of the project was out of 100 days, -30 were rainy and 101 were cold. Thus, the program generated the result that -30% of days were rainy and 101% were cold. These are obviously nonsensical results as you cannot have a negative percentile, nor can you have more days that were cold than there were total days sampled. Error messagesThe two distinct errors I made in my program were deleting the declaration of one of the variables (daysWithRain) specifically and leaving off a “;” after a line of code. This resulted in the error messages “use of undeclared identifier ‘daysWithRain’” and “expected ‘;’ after expression”, respectively. Ultimately, the program wouldn’t build with these two errors in place.
